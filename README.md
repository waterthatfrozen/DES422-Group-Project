## Project Information

Wordled is a clone of popular web-based word game, Wordle. The player must guess the correct 5-letter word within 6 tries. After each try, the hints will be provided according to how close you are to the correct word. You can read the instruction of the game at the How to Play page. After each game has been played, we will collect the game score, post it as the worldwide statistics, and display it as a bar chart.
